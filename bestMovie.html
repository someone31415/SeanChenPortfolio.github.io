	<h2 style="color:rgb(51, 102, 0);">Why this is my Favorite Movie</h2>
	
	
	
	
	<p>
		This is my favorite movie because I really enjoyed the storyline, visual effects, and the science behind the movie. The plot was very unique and interesting. The visual effects were great, and most of the content was scientifically accurate.

	<p>
		I don't have a favorite actor or actress, mainly because I barely know any. But I do admire the director, Christopher Nolan, and Kip Thorne, who helped ensure that the movie was as scientifically accurate as possible.
