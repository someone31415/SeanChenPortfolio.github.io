			<h2>Python Unit 1: Basics</h2>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<p>
				In this unit, we learned the basics of python. Our labs required us to create variables, do operations with variables and do "math tricks," and we constructed classes and use them. Also, we imported classes and used them in files that uses pygame for visuals.
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating variables</li>
				<li>Doing operations with variables</li>
				<li>Printing</li>
				<li>Constructing Classes</li>
				<li>Importing and using pygame</li>

			</ul>
		<h2>Python Unit 2: If statements</h2>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<p>
				We went over labs and slides that contained conditional if statements. The if statements checked if certain statements were true, and performed a specific set of actions if it was. In the labs, we used runners to run a program in pygame, and used objects from imported classes. We used if statements for checking for collision, checking for game over or wining, and if objects went out of the screen.
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Using a runner file with imported classes</li>
				<li>Using if statements to check for collision</li>
				<li>Using if statements to end the game</li>
				<li>Using if statements to put objects back into the screen</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Python Unit 3: Loops</h2>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<p>
				We went over labs and slides that taught us about loops. We used for loops and while loops to allow our game to continue, and to take in multiple inputs from the user. A lab that we did was similar to what we did in Unit 2, there was a runner and imported classes, but we included a timer, score, a coin that would move once it gets touched, and movement in all 4 directions.
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Using a timer</li>
				<li>Keeping score and time</li>
				<li>Using loops to continue the game</li>
				<li>Setting random positions</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Python Unit 4: Lists</h2>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<p>
				We used lists in this lab to change costumes and create multiple objects from the same class file. We had a runner file where the user would control a player, whose costume changes based on the direction it is moving. Also, we had a runner where there were multiple enemies that were created in a list that needed to be avoided.
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Having multiple images for different costumes in a list</li>
				<li>Creating classes that can create multiple objects in a list</li>
				<li>Making a background that is not uniform</li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Final Python Project</h2>
			<h2>Description:</h2>
			<p>
				For our final project, we needed to create a game that uses everything we learned. We were required to have variables, methods, classes, user interaction, graphics, and multiple levels. We also learned some new concepts while making the project.
			</p>
			<h2>Concepts Learned:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Using a scrolling background</li>
				<li>Inserting music</li>
				<li>Making a game on our own</li>
			</ul>
